# Aeneas evaluation (task 17.3, R46.1)

One pure control law (`controllaw/`: a fixed-point PI step with anti-windup
and output saturation) translated to Lean by Aeneas and proven there, to
evaluate Aeneas as a Lean-level alternative to the App_Prover (Creusot) for
small computations. The evaluation is recorded in the Verification_Plan,
section 7; the pins in `toolchain/decision.toml` `[aeneas]`.

Layout:

- `controllaw/`: the Rust crate (no dependencies, `#![no_std]`,
  `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`), excluded from the workspace; its own tests run
  with `cargo test` in the directory.
- `lean/`: the Lean project. `ControlLaw/Controllaw.lean` is the Aeneas
  translation (generated, committed as a reviewable artifact);
  `ControlLaw/Proofs.lean` holds the handwritten proofs. `lake build` checks
  them; the verification job runs it where `lake` is installed.

Regenerating the translation (needs the pinned Charon and Aeneas built in
the sibling checkout `../../../aeneas`, see its README):

```sh
cd proofs/aeneas/controllaw
../../../../aeneas/charon/bin/charon cargo --preset=aeneas      # writes controllaw.llbc
../../../../aeneas/bin/aeneas -backend lean -dest ../lean/ControlLaw controllaw.llbc
```

The `.llbc` file is not committed (`.gitignore`); the Lean translation is.

## The Analyzer's response-time fixed point (Verification_Plan 7.2)

`lean/Rta/Rta.lean` is the Aeneas translation of `rta::fixpoint` and the two
functions it calls, taken from `crates/rsk-analyzer` itself as rustc
compiles it without Verus (the `verus!` macro erases the ghost code);
`lean/Rta/Proofs.lean` holds the handwritten proofs. `lake build` in `lean/`
checks both libraries.

Regenerating the translation:

```sh
cd crates/rsk-analyzer
../../../aeneas/charon/bin/charon cargo --preset=aeneas \
    --start-from 'crate::rta::fixpoint' --dest-file /tmp/rta.llbc -- --lib
../../../aeneas/bin/aeneas -backend lean -dest ../../proofs/aeneas/lean/Rta /tmp/rta.llbc
```

`--lib` keeps Charon to the library target (the binary has no `rta` module
of its own). Charon builds the crate's dependencies with its pinned nightly,
`vstd` and the Verus macros among them; set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to keep that
build out of the workspace's target directory.
