# Aeneas evaluation (task 17.3, R46.1)

One pure control law (`controllaw/`: a fixed-point PI step with anti-windup
and output saturation) translated to Lean by Aeneas and proven there, to
evaluate Aeneas as a Lean-level alternative to the App_Prover (Creusot) for
small computations. The evaluation is recorded in the Verification_Plan,
section 7; the pins in `toolchain/decision.toml` `[aeneas]`.

Layout:

- `controllaw/`: the Rust crate (no dependencies, `#![no_std]`,
  `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`), excluded from the workspace; its own tests run
  with `cargo test` in the directory.
- `lean/`: the Lean project. `ControlLaw/Controllaw.lean` is the Aeneas
  translation (generated, committed as a reviewable artifact);
  `ControlLaw/Proofs.lean` holds the handwritten proofs. `lake build` checks
  them; the verification job runs it where `lake` is installed.

Regenerating the translation (needs the pinned Charon and Aeneas built in
the sibling checkout `../../../aeneas`, see its README):

```sh
cd proofs/aeneas/controllaw
../../../../aeneas/charon/bin/charon cargo --preset=aeneas      # writes controllaw.llbc
../../../../aeneas/bin/aeneas -backend lean -dest ../lean/ControlLaw controllaw.llbc
```

The `.llbc` file is not committed (`.gitignore`); the Lean translation is.
