# HIL stress run: Overrun and interrupt-storm fault injection (task 7.5, R18.8, R19.3)

Verdict: **pass**

Operating duration 180 s on the target 1366:1060:001050217737 with the stimulus board 1366:1061:001050279833; analyzer fx2lafw at 100000 Hz; J_rel bound 10000 cycles.

## Steps

| Step | Result | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| stimulus running | pass | flashed in 5.1 s and reset |
| EasyDMA traffic (R17.4) | pass | SPIM0 of part2 chaining 64-byte transfers on both channels at 8 Mbps: a transfer ended before 0 of 0 sampler Jobs; transfers still running after the Kernel's stop at a restart: 0; ENABLE 7, SHORTS 0x0, RXD.MAXCNT 64, TXD.MAXCNT 64, END 1, STOPPED 1 at the end |
| loop iterations (R34.9, R35.4) | pass | 7 Application loops in the export, 7 observed: 0 reached the bound, 0 exceeded, 2 below the bound with the justification recorded, 0 below without one, 5 never completed in this configuration, 0 not observed |
| target run | pass | RSK-OK after 205 s (operating duration 180 s) |
| release timing (R9.10) | pass | 40495 periodic Releases recorded over 5 Tasks; every nominal instant O + k*T: yes; lag max 8815 cycles (137.7 µs) against J_rel 10000 cycles |
| WCRT of the protected Partition (R18.8) | pass | part0.control: 18000 Jobs, response at most 1.614 ms (103312 cycles) against WCRT 9.887 ms (632800 cycles); part0.echo: 5999 Jobs, response at most 0.274 ms (17524 cycles) against WCRT 11.314 ms (724100 cycles); part0.sensor: 8999 Jobs, response at most 6.803 ms (435376 cycles) against WCRT 11.463 ms (733600 cycles) |
| interrupt storm (R19.3) | pass | Task 4's source stormed for 180 s: 11951 intakes against at most 12001 MIT windows of 15 ms (99.6 % of the windows); intake handler at most 2129 cycles (33.3 µs), mean 1940 cycles: the measured Δ_irq (bound 2600 cycles, R13.4); processor time 0.2013 % of the run |
| Kernel events | pass | 6754 events mirrored (512 held, 1 of them the post-detach reboot's): overrun of Task 3: 85, overrun of Task 5: 68, overrun of Task 6: 67, operating_end of Task none: 1, resource_released of Task 5: 68, partition_restart of Task none: 68, safe_state of Task none: 1, end_job of Task 3: 85, end_job of Task 6: 68; the trace never froze during the run |
| counter wraps | pass | the 32-bit time base wraps every 268 s: 0 wraps in the run; the trace's last tick carries high word 0 (instants ordered across the wrap, R9.5) |
| Kernel trace | pass | 512 entries; no interrupt re-entered without a dispatch |
| dispatch deferrals (5.8a) | pass | 0 entry-window occurrence(s) handled (a dispatch vector deferred, or an unwind owed to the stub, 0x1xxxx); 2700 actions recorded (32 held, 0 of them deferrals) |
| responses under the storm | pass | 11950 response edges inside the run (target counted 11950) against 12001 MIT windows; 0 stimulus rises on the mirror |
| dispatch timeline | pass | Tasks executing 38.8 % of the run, the Kernel 45.1 % over 1223466 entries; runs per Task [18050, 5999, 20997, 5472, 12023, 7402, 2153] |
| agent against the trace (task 19.1) | pass | Task 0: the Budget accounting's largest Job execution 22531 cycles (0.352 ms, cycle-counter read cost 1 cycles) against the trace pin's longest run 21760 cycles (0.340 ms at 100000 samples/s; 18050 runs for 18000 Jobs) |
