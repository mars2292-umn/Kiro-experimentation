//! The response configuration of the fault-injection suite (task 7.5,
//! R14.11; feature `nrf52840_response`): `nrf52840.rs` over 2 seconds with
//! one Partition declaring each response of the closed sets of R14.5,
//! and the Partition crates' `response` feature injecting, at fixed
//! instants, the faults that trigger them (Verification_Plan 11.4):
//! part0 (level A) RECORD_AND_CONTINUE for a Budget overrun and
//! RECORD_ONLY for a deadline miss, then SAFE_STATE for a fault at 1.9 s;
//! part1 (level C) END_JOB for an overrun and RESTART_PARTITION for a
//! fault; part2 (level B) END_JOB for a fault, END_JOB for an overrun
//! inside a Critical_Section (which escalates to RESTART_PARTITION,
//! R18.4), and STOP_PARTITION for a deadline miss (its Jobs held pending
//! past their deadlines by sensor's 120 ms Job). The rig judges the run
//! from the Kernel's event mirror and the counts; the target's own
//! verdict is only that the report ran.
